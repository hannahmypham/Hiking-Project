## About the project
As a hiker, I enjoy exploring different hiking trails near my city or in national parks. From the new type of plants to bugs or new views at the top, I always learn something new every time I hike. Therefore, I decided to combine my passion for data and my love for hiking with this project. I analyze one of the most famous national parks which spreads from Washington to Oregon: Columbia River Gorge National Park.

## About the dataset
The dataset provides information of 172 trails in this park. 

The columns include: trail names, trail type, distance, high point, elevation gain, difficulty level, whether or not it is family friendly, backpackagle, and crowded. 

## Questions for the analysis
1. What is the most challenging trail? What is the easiest trail to conquer?
2. How many trails are available all year long?
3. What trails are suitable for a family? 
4. How many trails are backpacker friendly? 
5. What type of hikers do I recommend to explore this national park? 

## Key takeaway 
1. The most challenging trail is Wahtum Lake Via Ruckel Creek Hike. The easiest trails are Sames Walker Loop Hike, Hood River Waterfront Hike, and Fort Cascades Loop Hike
2. 108 trails are available all year long, which accounts for 62.79% of the total trails in Columbia River Gorge National Park.
3. Trails that are suitable for families are usually easy trails that are family-friendly, available all year, and not crowded. There are 16 trails that satisfy those criteria with 14 loop trails and 12 out-and-back trails. Those include Ainsworth Loop Hike, Balfour - Klickitat Loop Hike, Buck Creek on Larch Mountain Hike, and other trails.
4. There are 41 trails that are suitable for backpackers with different level of difficulties and trail types.

## Recommendations
1.The majority of trails at Columbia Gorge National Park are at easy and moderate level. In addition, more than half of the traisl that are available all yea long, family friendly and backpackable. 
2. However, those trails could be crowded for hikers. 
3. Overall, this park is more suitable for family to explore together, there are trails with difficult level that are perfect for professional hikers who love to backpacking. 

## Tools used during analysis
### SQL for data quality check and cleaning
1. SQL Case When to categorize data
2. SQL window functions to detect duplications
3. SQL text functions (LIKE, LEFT, POSITION) to extract data 

### Tableau + Figma for visualization
1. Top N filter
2. Slicer Filters using Parameters Actions and Calculated Fields
3. Figma to design dashboard background 
4. Aesthetic color choice with a diverging scheme to illustrate the intensity
