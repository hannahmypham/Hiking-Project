## About the project
As a hiker, I enjoy exploring different hiking trails near my city or in national parks. From new type of plants to bugs or new view at the top, I always learn something new everytime I hike. Therfore, I decided to combine my passion for data and my love for hiking with this project. I analyze one of the most famous national Park which spreads from Washington to Oregon: Columbia River Gorge National Park.

## About the dataset
The dataset provides information of 172 trails in this park. 

The columns include: trail names, trail type, distance, high point, elevation gain, difficulty level, whether or not it is family friendly, backpackagle, and crowded.
