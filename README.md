## About the project
As a hiker, I enjoy exploring different hiking trails near my city or in national parks. From new type of plants to bugs or new view at the top, I always learn something new everytime I hike. Therfore, I decided to combine my passion for data and my love for hiking with this project. I analyze one of the most famous national Park which spreads from Washington to Oregon: Columbia River Gorge National Park.

## About the dataset
The dataset provides information of 172 trails in this park. 

The columns include: trail names, trail type, distance, high point, elevation gain, difficulty level, whether or not it is family friendly, backpackagle, and crowded. 

## Questions for the analysis
1. What is the most challenging trail? What is the easiest trail to conquer?
2. How many trails are available all year long?
3. What trails that are suitable for family? 
4. How many trails that are backpacker friendly? 

## Key takeaway
